1. How would you create an OrderedPair object with values (4.0, -5.0) using BlueJ?

Open your project and right click your "OrderedPair" class. Choose the "new OrderedPair"
button and enter "4.0" for the X value and "-5.0" for the Y value. 


2. How could you do this with code instead? 

You can make a new class and include: OrderedPair p = new OrderedPair(4.0, -5.0);


3. What happens if you print an OrderedPair object to the console, the way you might 
print an int? What does this output mean?
 

This gets printed: "OrderedPair@45cf62c3"


4. Now what happens if you print an OrderedPair object to the console? What changed? 

The X and Y values are printed: "4.0, -5.0"
